# weather_app

A new Flutter project uses an online weather API to show the weather of a city the user wants to search for.
Also, I used Bloc/Cubit as a state management.

The main features of the app are:

  - Search for a city to know its weather.
  - Show the city's temperature.
  - Show the city's max/min temperature.
  - Show the city's weather conditions.
